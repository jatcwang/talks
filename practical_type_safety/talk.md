Principles:
- A semantic code change should be compile errors
- A type communicates a constraint, and it should always hold (don't lie about it)
- Typesafety is a means to an end, but not the gold itself. (Think about maintainability and ergonomic). Many contraints

- Avoid default parameters
- Use named parameters
- Make illegal state unrepresentable
- New type wrappers (including unsafeFromString)
